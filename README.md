# My Web Profile

This project is my first web profile, I did it with the knowledge I learned in 7 months as a Front End Developer!

I hope you enjoy it and if you have any improvements or suggestions, feel free to fork and develop your feature.

# How to work on it

After downloading the project, follow the steps below:

NOTE: Download the node on your machine, I used version 10.16.3, but more updated versions should also work.

1- npm install
2- npm start

(Optional) If you wanted to build the files, execute the steps below, but it will have no impact on production.

1- npm run gulp copy
2- npm run gulp usemin

Ready! You can start developing your feature, after the end just open the pull request and await my approval!
